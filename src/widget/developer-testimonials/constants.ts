Despite some hiccups, the Adapty team was always there to help us during the migration and afterward, and their support is top-notch. I recommend Adapty as a reliable partner.",

Adapty introduced numerous features over the years and constantly helped us grow. They have the best analytics on the market and all the integrations you can think of. If you looking to boost the revenue of your app, I definitely recommend Adapty.",

      quote: "We've tested more than three hundred paywalls in the space of four months. Adapty allows testing basically any element of the paywall, and we took advantage of that. We've tested them all: products, title text, CTA buttons, images, videos etc. With Adapty's A/B testing, we managed to double our monthly revenue. I wasn't sure if one instrument could make such an impact, but I witnessed it myself.",
